#what is fly-ambio
It is a rc controlled plane which can fly over 300km/h planned it has a very aerodynamic desgin and hopes to break the 300km/h speed barier as well hope full i break it !!

Okay so The reason i built this was I love avation in general my fav jet is f-35 i love the tech it has and how fast it can fly as well obv there are more which can go faster but nothing actaully has the tech as in f-35 and flying is just sooo cool imagine a megaa ton mody lifting flying 10000s for feet in the sky when i can baerly get my legs off the ground for jumping
so To make something ive always loved wating vids about i decided to make one
